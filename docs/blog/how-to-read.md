# How to Read Posts

Each post is designed to be *arguable*.
If you disagree, you should be able to point to the exact link in the causal chain.

## The standard structure

1. The causal question
2. Executive summary
3. The causal model (Y, X, mediators, moderators, confounders)
4. Diagrams (DAG + feedback loop)
5. Mechanism walkthrough
6. Evidence & uncertainty audit
7. Interventions & measurement plans

## What to look for

- explicit assumptions
- where evidence is strong vs. weak
- what data would change the conclusion
