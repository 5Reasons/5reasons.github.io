# Operating Model

We work backwards from the failure mode that matters most:

> In high-stakes domains, a confident fabrication is not a minor bug. It’s an unacceptable risk.

## The engagement loop

1. **Clarify the decision** (what outcome matters, what can’t be wrong).
2. **Map the domain** (entities, processes, constraints, provenance).
3. **Encode governance** (hard constraints, auditability, escalation paths).
4. **Build the memory layer** (graph + sources + traces).
5. **Prove it works** (counterfactual tests, red teaming, operational monitoring).

## What we optimize for

- **Traceability** over fluency
- **Abstention** over improvisation
- **Constraints** over prompt discipline
- **Durable semantics** over model loyalty

## What you get

A system that can answer:

- *What do we know?*
- *How do we know it?*
- *What would change our conclusion?*
