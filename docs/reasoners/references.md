## What we’ve built — and what it took

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			We didn’t arrive at brModel™ in a vacuum.
			It is the outcome of long cycles of building real software, modeling messy domains, and learning where “plausible AI” fails under real constraints.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>25+ years</strong> of software engineering experience across complex, real-world systems.</li>
			<li><strong>~10 years</strong> of experience modeling ontologies and cognitive structures for expert work.</li>
			<li>Repeated exposure to the same bottleneck: <strong>unified semantics</strong> + <strong>governance</strong> + <strong>traceability</strong> are what make AI deployable.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These references help validate that trajectory.
			They come from experts across enterprise software, academia, biomedical research, and applied industry domains.

### Enterprise software and strategic leadership

- <strong>Ing. Milan Hán</strong> — former executive director of SAP Slovakia; long-term advisor to the bigRing project. Under his leadership, SAP Slovakia reached major scale in enterprise applications; he continues to support strategic direction.

### Biomedical and life sciences

- <strong>Dr. Ivan Juráš</strong> (Lambda Life a.s.) — describes value in biomedical research and personalized medicine: linking heterogeneous sources and building causal relationships for therapy and intervention design.
- <strong>Dr. Robert Mistrík</strong> (CEO, Bitmoderna, s.r.o.) — highlights unifying structured and unstructured data for proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics; benefits across research and commercial life sciences.
- <strong>Dr. Jana Lomenová, PhD</strong> (Slovak Academy of Sciences) — frames the platform as “shared long-term memory” enabling disciplinary knowledge databases (e.g., SERCA research) and faster collaborative progress.

### Academia and research institutions

- <strong>Prof. Anton Horváth, PhD</strong> (Comenius University) — sees strong potential for managing large information bases in biochemistry; more efficient retrieval supporting researchers and students.
- <strong>Dr. Mojmír Mach, PhD</strong> (Slovak Academy of Sciences) — emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration: experts share experience and collaborate directly within a unified environment.

### Public sector, finance, and applied analytics

- <strong>Dr. Juraj Waczulík, PhD</strong> (EXIMBANK SR) — emphasizes the platform as a tool for managing and storing data/metadata and discovering hidden information; automated collection from public sources accelerates analytical work.

### Industry and operations

- <strong>Ing. Jaroslav Holeček, PhD</strong> — automotive industry expert; former VW SK board member; validates the vision and research direction; long-standing innovation and education focus.

### Real estate and management

- <strong>Jens-Peter Clarfeld</strong> — expert with 20+ years across domestic and international markets; consulting across real estate assets and strategic management; prior successful collaboration in Germany.
