			<p class="landing-kicker">Reasoners → licensing</p>
			<h2 class="landing-title">Public to read does not mean free to reuse.</h2>
			<p class="landing-subtitle">
				This page defines the licensing terms for using brModel™ and the intellectual content published on this site.
				If you need commercial, research, or machine-learning rights, you must obtain an explicit written license.

## Scope

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			This license governs the use of:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>brModel™</strong> as a methodology/standard and its described components, conventions, schemas, and constraints</li>
			<li><strong>All intellectual content</strong> published on this site (text, diagrams, models, artifacts, and structure), unless explicitly stated otherwise</li>
			<li>Any <strong>derivative works</strong> substantially based on the above</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If a specific page or artifact states additional terms, those terms apply for that item.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

## What you may do by default (no license required)

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<ul>
			<li>View and read the content for personal, informational purposes</li>
			<li>Share links to pages on this site</li>
			<li>Quote short excerpts for commentary, with attribution and a link back (where lawful)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

## What requires an explicit written license

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>Unless you have an explicit written license from 5Reasons, you may not:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reuse the content commercially (including consulting deliverables, internal playbooks, paid products, or customer-facing materials)</li>
			<li>Reuse the content for research (academic or otherwise) beyond minimal fair-use quotation</li>
			<li>
				Use the content for machine learning, including training, fine-tuning, evaluation, dataset creation,
				embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) corpora, or automated extraction at scale
			</li>
			<li>Copy, redistribute, mirror, republish, or create derivative works based on the content</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

## How licensing works (practically)

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			brModel™ licensing is not one-size-fits-all.
			The correct license depends on scope (commercial vs research), deployment context, and governance requirements.
		</p>
		<p>
			To obtain a license, start a conversation:
			<a class="md-button md-button--primary" href="/services/start/">Start a Conversation</a>
		</p>
		<p class="landing-mini">
			We will clarify scope, intended use, redistribution, derivative works, and (where relevant) ML / model training constraints.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

## Relationship to the repository license

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			This page is about licensing <strong>brModel™ and the content published on this website</strong>.
			The open-source license in the GitHub repository (if any) governs the <strong>source code</strong> in that repository.
			It does not grant you rights to reuse the brModel™ methodology or the site’s intellectual content beyond what is stated here.
