				We optimize for decision-grade systems: enforceable constraints, auditable traces, and durable semantics.
				If you want a cheap chatbot, we are not a fit.

## Are you an AI agency?

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			Not in the “chatbot factory” sense.
			We build cognitive infrastructure: memory, constraints, provenance, and auditability.
			Think: <strong>data architects for the AI era</strong>.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

## Do we need to replace our stack?

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			No. We aim for a <strong>sidecar approach</strong>: we connect to what you already run (data stores, tools, models)
			and add a governed memory and reasoning layer.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

## Why does governance matter so much?

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			Because in high-stakes domains, errors have real costs: regulatory exposure, financial loss, reputational damage, safety incidents.
			Constraints are cheaper than incidents.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

## Why are you expensive?

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			Because we solve problems that cost millions when they fail.
			Most of the work is not writing code — it’s designing what “truth” means in your organization:
			semantics, constraints, evidence, and measurable reliability.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

## What’s the usual starting point?

<div class="landing-section">
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			An <strong>Epistemic Audit</strong>.
			It’s the fastest way to turn uncertainty into a roadmap with measurable milestones.
