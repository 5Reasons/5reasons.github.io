# Core Primitives

A durable memory system must represent reality in a way that survives model churn.

## What we treat as first-class

- **Subjects**: who acts
- **Processes**: what happens
- **Objects**: what is manipulated
- **Relations**: how things connect
- **Sources**: where we learned it (provenance)

## Why provenance matters

Without provenance, you can’t:

- audit
- debug
- assign confidence
- decide what data would falsify a claim

This is the difference between “an answer” and “a decision-grade answer.”
