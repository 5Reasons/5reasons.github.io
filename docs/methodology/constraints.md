# Constraints & SHACL

If a rule matters, it must be enforceable.

## The problem with prompt-only governance

Prompt instructions are:

- editable
- bypassable
- hard to audit

## The constraint approach

Encode rules as constraints that validate actions and outputs.

Examples:

- role-based prohibitions
- sector restrictions
- required citations
- threshold limits

## Operational result

A system that refuses to cross boundaries, and produces a machine-verifiable reason when it abstains.
