# Reasoners × 5Reasons

We build **decision-grade cognitive infrastructure** and publish **causal analysis** you can argue with.

## Two complementary tracks

### Reasoners (consulting & infrastructure)

For organizations where hallucination is unacceptable.

- Start with [Reasoners](reasoners/index.md)
- The technical core: [brModel™ Methodology](methodology/index.md)
- What we offer: [Services](services/index.md)

### 5Reasons (writing & diagrams)

Public-facing causal posts and reusable models.

## How the blog works

Most writing explains *what happened*. 5Reasons is about *why it happened* — and which levers change the outcome.

Each post follows a consistent structure:

1. The causal question
2. The causal model (variables + counterfactuals)
3. Diagrams (DAG + feedback loop)
4. Mechanism walkthrough
5. Evidence & uncertainty
6. Interventions & leverage points
