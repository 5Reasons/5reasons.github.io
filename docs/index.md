# 5Reasons

Decision-grade causal analysis for product, operations, and organizations.

Most writing explains *what happened*. 5Reasons is about *why it happened* — and which levers change the outcome.

## Start here

- Read the [Blog](blog/index.md) for causal walkthroughs, intervention maps, and uncertainty audits.
- Browse the [Diagram Gallery](diagrams/index.md) for visual models you can reuse.

## What you’ll find

- **Causal models you can argue with**: explicit variables, confounders, and counterfactuals.
- **Mechanisms, not slogans**: step-by-step chains that survive scrutiny.
- **Interventions with measurement plans**: levers, risks, prerequisites, and how to tell if it worked.
