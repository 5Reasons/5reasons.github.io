# Inquiry: Start a Decision-Grade Engagement

You are here because **"plausible" is not enough.**

In high-stakes domains—medicine, finance, law, infrastructure—an AI system cannot just generate fluent text. It must be able to **trace its reasoning**, **enforce strict governance constraints**, and **abstain** when evidence is missing.

We do not sell generic chatbot licenses. We architect **causal memory systems** that turn messy enterprise reality into auditable, deterministic workflows.

### Who this is for
We work best with organizations where the cost of error is high. If you operate in these domains, we speak your language:

*   **Biomedicine & Pharma** (Clinical trials, mechanism discovery)
*   **Finance & Insurance** (Compliance, underwriting, claims)
*   **Legal & Governance** (Contract logic, regulatory enforcement)
*   **Cybersecurity & Energy** (SOC automation, grid safety)
*   **Manufacturing & Engineering** (Root-cause analysis, supply chain)

### Why we ask for detail
The form below is not a generic contact box. It is a **diagnostic tool**.

We ask about **failure modes**, **constraints**, and **systems of record** because we build architectures, not just prompts. Your answers allow us to determine—before we ever get on a call—whether your problem requires a full Causal Architecture Blueprint, a targeted Epistemic Audit, or if a simpler solution might suffice.

**Please provide as much context as possible regarding the decision you need to automate and the risks you need to mitigate.**
