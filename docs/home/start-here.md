# Start Here

This site has two complementary layers:

- **Reasoners**: consulting and cognitive infrastructure—how to build decision-grade systems.
- **5Reasons**: public writing—causal models and diagrams you can reuse.

## If you’re a buyer / operator

Go to:

- [Services](../services/index.md) → see how we engage and what outcomes look like.
- [Case Studies](../case-studies/index.md) → see mechanisms, governance, and auditability in action.

## If you’re an engineer / architect

Go to:

- [Methodology](../methodology/index.md) → the building blocks, traces, and constraints.
- [Philosophy](../philosophy/index.md) → the “why” behind glass-box systems.

## If you’re here for the writing

Go to:

- [Blog](../blog/index.md) → posts you can argue with.
- [Diagram Gallery](../diagrams/index.md) → fast preview of diagrams.

## The default stance

When evidence is missing, a system should **abstain** rather than improvise.
That single design choice changes everything downstream: architecture, evaluation, governance, and product UX.
