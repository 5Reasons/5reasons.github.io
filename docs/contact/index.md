# Contact & Collaboration

Note: this page is being replaced by a simpler entry point. Use [Start a Conversation](../services/start.md).

If hallucination is unacceptable in your domain, we should talk.

We work with partners solving **high-stakes problems** in:

- healthcare and biotech
- finance and compliance
- legal and policy
- complex engineering

## The fastest way to start

A short, no-commitment call to evaluate fit.

- **Discovery call (30 min):** `https://calendly.com/` (placeholder)

## What we’ll cover

1. Your risk profile: hallucinations, compliance, audit requirements
2. Your data reality: PDFs, SQL, spreadsheets, knowledge bases
3. The right starting point: audit vs. blueprint vs. implementation

## Contact details (skeleton)

- Email: (to be added)
- Location: Remote worldwide
- LinkedIn: (to be added)

Prefer to start asynchronously? Open an issue in the repo with a short problem statement.
