# FAQ

## Are you an AI agency?

Not in the “chatbot factory” sense.
We build cognitive infrastructure: memory, constraints, and auditability.

## Do we need to replace our stack?

No. We aim for a sidecar approach: integrate with what you already run.

## Why does governance matter so much?

Because in high-stakes domains, errors have real costs.
Constraints are cheaper than incidents.

## What’s the usual starting point?

An Epistemic Audit.
It’s the fastest way to turn uncertainty into a roadmap.
