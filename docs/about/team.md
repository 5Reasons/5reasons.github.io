			<p class="landing-kicker">About → who we are</p>
			<h2 class="landing-title">A small, elite team building cognitive infrastructure for high-stakes domains.</h2>
			<p class="landing-subtitle">
				We are Reasoners: architects, ontology engineers, and systems builders.
				We don’t scale by hiring dozens of juniors. We scale by applying rigorous methodology and durable standards.

	<h2>Origin story</h2>
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>
			Many of us started in environments where errors were not acceptable.
			Our roots reach into biomedical informatics — one of the most complex and highest-risk data domains.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over years of watching companies deploy AI into critical processes, we kept seeing the same sequence:
			(1) excitement from the demo, (2) frustration in production, (3) fear when real consequences show up.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem is rarely “the model”. The problem is that systems lack <strong>memory</strong> and <strong>boundaries</strong>.
			That’s why we build brModel™: infrastructure that makes reasoning auditable and governance enforceable.
		</p>

<div class="landing-section">
	<h2>Our philosophy: Logic-first</h2>
	<div class="landing-callout">
		<p><strong>Most AI work is model-first. We are logic-first.</strong></p>
		<p class="landing-mini">Models are a commodity. Your domain logic and data reality are not.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="landing-grid">
		<div class="landing-card">
			<h3>Human-in-the-loop</h3>
			<p>AI does heavy retrieval and structured reasoning. Humans own decisions and accountability.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="landing-card">
			<h3>No lock-in</h3>
			<p>We favor open standards (W3C, OWL, RDF) where practical. What we build is yours.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="landing-card">
			<h3>Design for audits</h3>
			<p>Production systems must explain themselves: constraints, traces, provenance, and clear abstention.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="landing-card">
			<h3>Governance is enforced</h3>
			<p>Prompt-only safety is fragile. We build constraint gates that make violations impossible.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="landing-section">
	<h2>How we scale</h2>
	<div class="landing-card">
		<p>Not by volume — by rigor:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Repeatable methodology</li>
			<li>Durable domain models</li>
			<li>Enforceable governance</li>
			<li>Traceable reasoning artifacts</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="landing-section">
	<h2>What we avoid</h2>
	<div class="landing-card">
		<ul>
			<li>Prompt-only safety</li>
			<li>Model worship</li>
			<li>Fragile demos that cannot survive audits</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
