# About

We are **Reasoners**: a boutique team of cognitive infrastructure architects.

We don’t scale by hiring dozens of juniors. We scale by applying rigorous methodology and durable standards.

## Logic-first, not model-first

Most AI work is “model-first”: pick an LLM, then iterate prompts until it looks good.

We are **logic-first**:

- models come and go
- domain semantics and constraints stay
- provenance and auditability are non-negotiable

## Principles

- **Human-in-the-loop**: AI does the heavy retrieval; humans own decisions.
- **No lock-in**: open standards where possible; portability over vendor dependence.
- **Design for audits**: production systems must explain themselves.
