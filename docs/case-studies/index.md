# Case Studies

Theory is cheap. In high-stakes work, outcomes matter.

This section is a curated set of case studies that show **what changes** when systems are built around causal memory, constraints, and traceability.

## Biomedicine — mechanism discovery

A causal pathfinding approach connects molecular entities into a mechanistic chain, enabling hypothesis validation beyond document similarity.

- [SK Biomedicine: CA IX → Hypoxia Mechanisms](biomedicine.md)

## Finance — compliance by design

Rules are enforced as constraints so the system cannot “talk its way out” of policy.

- [Credit Decisions Under Governance Constraints](finance.md)

## Legal — contract logic conflicts

Represent clauses and dependencies as a graph to detect contradictions that chat interfaces miss.

- [Contract Analysis: Detecting Logical Conflicts](legal.md)
