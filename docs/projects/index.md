# Projects

This section tracks the real work that informs the methodology and the service offerings.

## SK Biomedicine

A proof-of-quality domain where errors are unacceptable and mechanisms matter.

- See the write-up: [SK Biomedicine Case Study](../case-studies/biomedicine.md)

## DAIMOND (science lane)

A research-driven program for pushing causal inference and mechanism discovery under biomedical complexity.

*Skeleton:* we’ll publish a public-facing overview that avoids internal or partner-sensitive details.

## Productization lane

We aim to turn recurring patterns into reusable building blocks:

- repeatable ingestion patterns
- governance templates
- trace visualization
