# The Three Laws

## Law 1: No answer without evidence

If the system can’t point to a source, it should say **“I don’t know.”**

## Law 2: Order before speed

Structure the domain before automating decisions.

- define concepts
- define relationships
- define constraints
- only then attach models

## Law 3: Humans remain accountable

AI can assist, simulate, and recommend.
Humans own responsibility.

These laws are not slogans—they are implementation requirements.
