# Epistemic Audit

An Epistemic Audit answers one question:

> Are you structurally ready to deploy agentic AI without unacceptable hallucination risk?

## What we assess

- data sources (PDF, SQL, spreadsheets, KBs)
- current failure modes (fabrications, drift, inconsistency)
- missing concepts and relationships (ontology gaps)
- governance requirements and audit obligations

## Deliverables

- a candid readiness report
- prioritized risks and quick wins
- a roadmap with measurable milestones
