# Architecture Blueprint

This phase turns domain knowledge into a durable structure.

## Outputs

- domain model (concepts + relations)
- constraint model (what must never happen)
- ingestion strategy (how facts and sources enter)
- reference architecture (components + responsibilities)

## Why clients like this phase

Because it reduces vendor lock-in.
You own the semantics and constraints, even if models change.
