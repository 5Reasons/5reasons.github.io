# Services

We don’t sell licenses. We sell **epistemic safety**: the ability to trust what an AI system says and does.

Our work is structured to minimize risk and make outcomes measurable.

## 1) Epistemic Audit (diagnosis)

For teams that need a reality check before scaling agentic AI.

**Deliverables**

- AI readiness report (data quality, failure modes, hallucination risk)
- ontology / concept gap analysis
- a staged roadmap with measurable milestones

## 2) Causal Architecture Blueprint (design)

For teams building a “corporate brain”: durable semantics and constraints.

**Deliverables**

- domain ontology (client-owned)
- governance rules and constraint design
- data ingestion strategy and reference architecture

## 3) Glass-Box Implementation (execution)

For teams that want an end-to-end production system.

**Deliverables**

- deployed graph-based memory layer
- auditable reasoning traces
- monitoring and operational playbook

## Long-term partnership (retainer)

We act as an external office of AI architecture: reviewing new models, auditing changes, and evolving governance.
