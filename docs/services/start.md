# Start a Conversation

We’re a strong fit if:

- hallucination is unacceptable
- audits or compliance matter
- your data reality is messy (PDF + SQL + knowledge bases)

## What we need (minimal)

1. The decision you want to support (and what must never be wrong)
2. The data sources involved
3. The constraints/policies that govern the domain

## Next step

- Start with an **Epistemic Audit** if you want clarity fast.
- Start with a **Blueprint** if you already know you must build durable semantics and constraints.

If you want, tell me what contact channel you prefer to publish (email, Calendly link). We’ll place it here and in About.
